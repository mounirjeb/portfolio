        <div class="projet-professionnel">
            <h3>Professional project</h3>
            <p>My professional journey begins with obtaining my bachelor's degree in computer technology, followed by seeking a position as a systems administrator, network administrator, or in the field of security and cloud computing. Driven by a constant desire for learning, I am committed to pursuing training and obtaining leading certifications such as those offered by Cisco, Microsoft, Linux, and Google. This will enable me to develop new skills and stay current in an ever-evolving IT industry. With these certifications and skills, I am confident in my ability to advance in the hierarchy and take on roles with increasing responsibilities.
                Simultaneously, I am committed to improving my language skills, particularly in French, Dutch, and English, with the aim of becoming trilingual. In the long term, I aim to acquire extensive versatility and in-depth expertise in various areas of computer science.
